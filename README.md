# opencv-playground
Personal playground for opencv.

Each subdirectory contains some simple python code that I've been playing around with. The ```images``` directory

All scripts can be executed directly.

For example:
```
python circles/circles.py circles/coins.png
```

Code is usually poor quality as it's mostly meant as for learning purposes.
